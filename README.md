# Apartments-Index
Alexa Voice Skill for finding apartments from Apartments.com

This reposotory contains the web-scraper fro Alexa Voice Skill developed from Amazon Developer Console (https://developer.amazon.com/dashboard) with Amazons Web Services (https://aws.amazon.com/) Lambda service as backend using DynamoDB as a database for user specific information. As no API present for Aparatments.com, we had to scrape the sample data from the site. This repository contains the web-scraper(cheerio and nodejs) used as well.

The whole project regarding the Alexa-Skill can be found here: https://github.com/AbhinavTuli/Apartments-Finder-for-Alexa.
